# BrewLocator

Once you have typed in the zip code it will list a set of breweries that are in that area code, if nothing is available in that zip code it will prompt you to wether you'd like to try again or to exit out. You will be able get the name of the brewery, the city it's in, it's address, and the website for the brewery. Have fun with it!
